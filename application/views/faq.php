						WHEN SHOULD I CALL THE MOVING COMPANY?
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p class="text-3 mb-0">The earlier, the better. Although actual assignments cannot be made not until a few days before the move, it is wiser to give the moving company 18 – 32 hours’ notice. If you give us enough lead time, our company will surely be able to meet the delivery schedule that has been set by you. We will notify you of the time for loading your items and the estimated schedule of arrival.</p>

						HOW MUCH DOES THE MOVE COST?
					</div>
					<div class="card-body">
						<p class="text-3 mb-0">This is actually one of the most frequently asked questions of the clients, and it has no definite answer. The cost of the move depends upon different factors including distance, weight, length of time, as well as the manpower involved. Usually, a move that is within our state of residence (Lagos state) varies based on exact location while interstate moves are based on distance. If you want to know the possible cost of your move, you should contact our company to request for a free estimate.</p>
